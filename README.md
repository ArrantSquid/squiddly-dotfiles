# Squiddly Dotfiles
Just another <expletive> dotfiles repo. Because that's what the
world needs right now.

## Usage
Clone the repo. Symlink the files/directories from aforementioned
cloned directory to the respective files in your $HOME directory.

You can, alternatively, run the `create_symlinks.sh` file which
will do that for you. As a note, it does not look at what you
currently have, back it up or anything. It just attempts to just
do a straight symlink. Nothing more nothing less.

## WARNING
A bash script that "automagically" sets up an environment for you
is wonderful, but please don't get pissed if it blows away your
settings. It does **_NO_** backup of any kind, so it's on you
to make sure you've backed up your stuff. Basically, don't be a
derp.
