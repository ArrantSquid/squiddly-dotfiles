# Dotfiles
Just another dotfiles repo. Because that's what the world needs right now.

## Usage
Clone the repo. Symlink the files/directories from aforementioned
cloned directory to the respective files in your $HOME directory.

## Ansible
Run `initial_setup.sh` and then after that run:
`ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml -i hosts`

That's all there is to it now.
