# Dotfiles
Just another dotfiles repo. Because that's what the world needs right now.

## Usage
Clone the repo. Symlink the files/directories from aforementioned
cloned directory to the respective files in your $HOME directory.

## Fabric
There's some base fabric stuff that exists for Mac. The only
prerequisites for you to use it is having [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed
and having [fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/) installed. The prerequisites
for those can be found on their pages. Once you have fabric installed you can
run `fab -l` from within the the root directory. To get specific
information about the individual commands run `fab -d <command name>`.
